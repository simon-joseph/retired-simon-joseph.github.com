<h3> Ansi C application that connects to website, uses wxWidgets.</h3>

<br />This application used to download content from Wroclaw’s urban transport site, analyse it and view it offline useful information. Unfortunately the site no longer exist and since the new site seems to be somewhat useful I see no need in linking to it with that application.
<br />
<br />Anyway it used to work like this. “Fresh” application needed a database to work. In order to create such one you could just choose Update from File menu. After that you could simply browse essential information about urban transport in Wroclaw.
<br />
<br />Anything useful left is probably the source so if you need to have a look how a site downloading or parsing could work feel free to check and use my code. Requires wxWidgets libraries and placing included .dll in Windows folder.
<br />
<br />Have fun
